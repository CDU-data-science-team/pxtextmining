sp,Staff,"A lot. Our baby girl was born 6 weeks premature, mid 2019. She had a 8 - 12 month assessment form filled by myself. In [Redacted for data protection], it was given to the home visitor on [Redacted for data protection]. Due to my girl not having stood up supported by that time, and also COVID preventing the home visitor doing a height measurement and head measurement, they told us that they would return in [Redacted for data protection] to check on the gross motor skills and to do a full height measurement etc.  We then had a second visit week commencing [Redacted for data protection], my baby girl was standing up at the sofa on her own and was weighed and measured.  The same home visitor as before then asked if I had filled in the assessment form and I told her we had given it to her on her last visit.  The very next thing she said was the form we were given was incorrect it was for a full term baby and we should have been given a premature baby assessment form, therefore, my baby was on target for her adjusted age and doing fine in all areas and so this second meeting was not required.  How can someone question whether we had filled in a form and then say in the next breath, the form filled in was for full term babies? My assumption here is the form has gone missing!!  I then asked whether there would be any further assessments and she told me no not until the baby is 2 years old.  Fast forward to [Redacted for data protection] - now had another letter requesting a growth review!!! The NHS website states that these weight checks etc should be carried out NO MORE than every 3 months and that once the 1 year assessment is complete the next one is at 2 years old.  We have had 3 in 3 months!!  I point blank refuse to go to this one and will not be going to anymore until my baby is 2 years old, it is taking time out of mine or my husbands work for each one of these assessments, we have now been lied to, more than once. If my baby girl is not on track for her growth why are we not being told at the assessment?  According to her red book, all her measurements are fine or are we being lied to again? If a further assessment is required I want a full reason as to why, I want an explanation on why we haven't been told at past assessments. I also want compensation for loss of earnings for every future assessment before 2 years old, we have to attend whilst in working hours! Get it sorted!",-4,Trust A,Trust A - Q1,30

cc,Care received,"All my contact with the Hope Centre has left me feeling desperate and frustrated. I was referred 18 months ago and, apart from my initial assessment, have yet to have any treatment. Communication is often contradictory, phone calls are not returned, staff do not introduce themselves and I am made to feel like a problem, when I try to clarify what is happening. Promises of treatment are made regularly but never fulfilled. During this telephone call I was told that the doctor was going to chase up my treatment, but that she thought it best to discharge me ""in the hope"" that the Stabilisation clinic would pick me up. She warned me that I may get lost in the system though. As my symptoms and mental health has worsened in the last three months to the point where I was considering self harm I asked if I should increase my medication (Fluoxetine) but the doctor suggested this was only a 'last resort' and that I should use Diazepam instead. She said if I couldn't get enough from my GP I could come to the Hope Centre for more. The phone call ended with the doctor assuring me that I wouldn't need to do anything, she would put into action the points raised. However, when I received the follow up letter a few days later it says that I am to call the Hope Centre in one month if I haven't had any further contact. Not only is that contradictory, but it puts pressure on me - the one suffering with PTSD, issues with trust, disorientation and disassociation - to make sure I don't fall out of the system.",-4,Trust A,Trust A - Q1,224

Adrian provided excellent advice following an in depth consultation to establish the problems I was experiencing with my tendon. Although I had been following a exercise regime from another NHS Trust found on line, several segments of the routines were unsuitable for my particularly condition. In consultation with Adrian I commenced a series of exercises to enable my injury to gain the strength and mobility to aid my movement mainly during walking the dog and other activities. Although the tendon became quite sore at times, when completing the exercises, I slowly began to appreciate the support from Adrian and the healing process was very evident.

With really bad tummy pains only to be told by the consultant to go home and manage pain at home. Which if that was the case I could have gone after the first day. The consultant advised she did not want to operate as I have had previous surgery on the same side, she would find it difficult to do the surgery and did not want to. Which I feel very let down by the nhs I have a cyst on my ovaries which is 5cm, been in pain for the last 7days and the consultant advised to manage pain at home , I really don’t see the point in this. I have had a cyst before which raptured after 7 days. So with my past medical history and the nhs website advising cysts that are 5cm or bigger and causing problems should be removed.

I have regularly received this type of treatment off doctors, I know they are busy, and they are good at what they do but seems that some doctors forget who they are talking to most of the time, which is sick and confused people. They do not seem to like it when patients know a lot about their conditions or us patients who like a proper in-depth explanation on everything that’s happening. But by them taking the extra 5-10 minutes explaining properly, can solve a lot of issues and confusion and lower our anxiety levels.
