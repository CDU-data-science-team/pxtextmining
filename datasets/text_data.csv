"sp","Staff","Professionalism/Competence Of Staff","A lot. Our baby girl was born 6 weeks premature, mid 2019. She had a 8 - 12 month assessment form filled by myself. In [Redacted for data protection], it was given to the home visitor on [Redacted for data protection]. Due to my girl not having stood up supported by that time, and also COVID preventing the home visitor doing a height measurement and head measurement, they told us that they would return in [Redacted for data protection] to check on the gross motor skills and to do a full height measurement etc.  We then had a second visit week commencing [Redacted for data protection], my baby girl was standing up at the sofa on her own and was weighed and measured.  The same home visitor as before then asked if I had filled in the assessment form and I told her we had given it to her on her last visit.  The very next thing she said was the form we were given was incorrect it was for a full term baby and we should have been given a premature baby assessment form, therefore, my baby was on target for her adjusted age and doing fine in all areas and so this second meeting was not required.  How can someone question whether we had filled in a form and then say in the next breath, the form filled in was for full term babies? My assumption here is the form has gone missing!!  I then asked whether there would be any further assessments and she told me no not until the baby is 2 years old.  Fast forward to [Redacted for data protection] - now had another letter requesting a growth review!!! The NHS website states that these weight checks etc should be carried out NO MORE than every 3 months and that once the 1 year assessment is complete the next one is at 2 years old.  We have had 3 in 3 months!!  I point blank refuse to go to this one and will not be going to anymore until my baby is 2 years old, it is taking time out of mine or my husbands work for each one of these assessments, we have now been lied to, more than once. If my baby girl is not on track for her growth why are we not being told at the assessment?  According to her red book, all her measurements are fine or are we being lied to again? If a further assessment is required I want a full reason as to why, I want an explanation on why we haven't been told at past assessments. I also want compensation for loss of earnings for every future assessment before 2 years old, we have to attend whilst in working hours! Get it sorted!","-4","Trust A","Trust A - Q1",30

He was told he had to do a fasting blood test, then the following morning nurses escorted him down to breakfast, although my husband told the nurse that he couldnâ€™t, the nurse still made him go down for it. After breakfast they came to do his fasting blood test but could not do it due to eating.

I was referred 18 months ago and, apart from my initial assessment, have yet to have any treatment. Communication is often contradictory, phone calls are not returned, staff do not introduce themselves and I am made to feel like a problem, when I try to clarify what is happening. Promises of treatment are made regularly but never fulfilled. During this telephone call I was told that the doctor was going to chase up my treatment, but that she thought it best to discharge me 'in the hope' that the Stabilisation clinic would pick me up. She warned me that I may get lost in the system though. As my symptoms and mental health has worsened in the last three months to the point where I was considering self harm I asked if I should increase my medication (Fluoxetine) but the doctor suggested this was only a 'last resort' and that I should use Diazepam instead. She said if I couldn't get enough from my GP I could come to the Hope Centre for more. The phone call ended with the doctor assuring me that I wouldn't need to do anything, she would put into action the points raised. However, when I received the follow up letter a few days later it says that I am to call the Hope Centre in one month if I haven't had any further contact. Not only is that contradictory, but it puts pressure on me - the one suffering with PTSD, issues with trust, disorientation and disassociation - to make sure I don't fall out of the system.","-4","Trust A","Trust A - Q1",224

"mm","Communication","Communication","Your website is terrible having several services maintain for different areas is inefficient and not at all beneficial to users. You could make you web portals and links much better. I was sign posted to you by my GP during a telephone consultation, due to the GP not being able to provide links, I had to seek further information directly, using the internet.  At first, web results took me to the Leicestershire pages, which simply told me 'I could self refer'. There were no hyper links, or at least no working ones.  The web page was very simplistic, and didn't seem to offer direct links to any useful material without me referring. This may not be the case, but that is my point, links should be very clear and concise. Advice leaflet links would be useful on the opening page. They could be all as user needs, and prevent them wasting time in the referral process. In a crisis situation, many people will struggle to process information, so it is highly important you present any you have openly and clearly. It also appears this services is predominately aimed at Nottingham resident, that is the impression I received after eventually finding the link to self referral.  Again even if that is not the case it is not helpful, when I feeling desperate enough to finally seek help.

"sp","Staff","Professionalism/Competence Of Staff","I had been experiencing Tendonitis for six month following stepping off a ladder incorrectly. However following treatment by a Chiropractor as we entered lockdown their services were suspended. I decided to make a self referral to the Physiotherapy Department and within a couple of weeks I was contacted by Adrian via a telephone consultation. Adrian provided excellent advice following an in depth consultation to establish the problems I was experiencing with my tendon. Although I had been following a exercise regime from another NHS Trust found on line, several segments of the routines were unsuitable for my particularly condition. In consultation with Adrian I commenced a series of exercises to enable my injury to gain the strength and mobility to aid my movement mainly during walking the dog and other activities. Although the tendon became quite sore at times, when completing the exercises, I slowly began to appreciate the support from Adrian and the healing process was very evident. To provide the consultation from Adrian during a pandemic I would imagine without a hands on approach clearly was very problematic for a physiotherapist. However following his expert knowledge and guidance, I am extremely grateful for his professional approach in providing the treatment to aid my mobility.","4","Trust A","Trust A - Q2",692

As a retired nurse myself working in the NHS for 37 yrs and my husband a retired doctor we obviously have a good knowledge of the NHS. We would definitely recommend your service to anyone in similar circumstances caring for a loved one at home requiring end-of-life care. 
My mum's death could not have been any better. When mum died on Saturday, XXXX and XXXX returned to complete the last 'offices'.
This enabled my mum to leave her beloved bungalow in a dignified way and I will be forever grateful to them for this.

The consultant advised she did not want to operate as I have had previous surgery on the same side, she would find it difficult to do the surgery and did not want to. Which I feel very let down by the nhs I have a cyst on my ovaries which is 5cm, been in pain for the last 7days and the consultant advised to manage pain at home , I really donâ€™t see the point in this. I have had a cyst before which raptured after 7 days. So with my past medical history and the nhs website advising cysts that are 5cm or bigger and causing problems should be removed.

Being ignored,shouted at,left to cry with such pain and anxiety and not getting full explanations about whatâ€™s going on is no way to treat us. I have regularly received this type of treatment off doctors, I know they are busy, and they are good at what they do but seems that some doctors forget who they are talking to most of the time, which is sick and confused people. They do not seem to like it when patients know a lot about their conditions or us patients who like a proper in-depth explanation on everything thatâ€™s happening. But by them taking the extra 5-10 minutes explaining properly, can solve a lot of issues and confusion and lower our anxiety levels.  There was lack of communication between the night doctor to the day doctor and my medications which made my stay much harder.","-4","Trust C","Trust C - Q2",14488

No face mask, wasnâ€™t enough space to move around safely and the room was dirty. Very disappointing when the wards have high risk patients. The day room needs to feel more homely your patients will still feel unwell all because they donâ€™t need hospital care they still need to be cared for as a person, not just a number.
