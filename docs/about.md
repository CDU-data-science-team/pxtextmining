# Project background

The pxtextmining project is hosted by Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust's Clinical Development Unit Data Science Team, and funded by NHS England's Insight and Feedback Team. The primary objective of the project is to create a machine learning model capable of analysing and categorising the free text data obtained through the [NHS England Friends and Family Test](https://www.england.nhs.uk/fft/) (FFT). In doing so, it will support better use of qualitative patient experience feedback by NHS provider organisations.

This package works together with the [experiencesdashboard](https://github.com/CDU-data-science-team/experiencesdashboard), a frontend coded in R/Shiny.

Joint documentation for the project as a whole is forthcoming.
