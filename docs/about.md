# Project background

The `pxtextmining` package is part of [the Patient Experience Qualitative Data Categorisation project](https://cdu-data-science-team.github.io/PatientExperience-QDC/). This project is is hosted by Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust's Clinical Development Unit Data Science Team, and funded by NHS England's Insight and Feedback Team.

The primary objective of the `pxtextmining` element is to create a machine learning model capable of categorising the free text data obtained through the [NHS England Friends and Family Test](https://www.england.nhs.uk/fft/) (FFT). In doing so, it will support better use of qualitative patient experience feedback by NHS provider organisations.

This package works together with the [experiencesdashboard](https://github.com/CDU-data-science-team/experiencesdashboard), a frontend coded in R/Shiny.
